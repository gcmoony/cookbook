# CookBook

Your personal digital recipe book.

## What does it do?

CookBook is a digital recipe book where you can store your own written recipes.
I often found myself taking screenshots of recipes or constantly referring back
to a video when I want to remake a recipe I've enjoyed. In this format, I can
add my add and modify recipes as necessary. This gives me the freedom to take
some creative variation, and easily save the changes I like.

Currently, it is capable of performing the following:

- Creating new recipe pages
- Searching recipes
- Editing existing recipes
- Deleting recipes
- Responsive for mobile devices (often how I use the site when cooking and not
  editing)

What I'd like to do in the future:

- Add authentication to bring the app online to share recipes
- Better implementation of using images (currently uses existing web links
  instead of direct upload)

### Demo
